A layout parser is like a super smart robot that helps us make sense of those papers.\n\nThe robot looks at each paper and tries to figure out what's going on. It asks itself questions like:\n\n* What are the words saying?\n* Where are the important parts, like headings or titles?\n* Are there any pictures or diagrams?\n\nTo answer these questions, the robot uses special tools called \"algorithms\" that help it understand what it sees. These algorithms are like super powerful magnifying glasses that can zoom in on tiny details and make sense of them.\n\nThe robot also has a special way of organizing all the information it finds. It creates a kind of map or blueprint of each paper, showing where everything is and how it's connected. This helps us understand what the paper is about and what's important to remember.\n\nSo, when we want to use one of these papers for something, like writing a report or making a presentation, the robot can help us by giving us all the information we need in a way that makes sense. It's like having our own personal research assistant!\n\nThat's basically how a layout parser works!", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "What did I ask previously?", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "You asked me to explain how a layout parser works, in a way that an elementary school student could understand.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}]
